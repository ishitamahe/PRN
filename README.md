# PRN
## AIM
To print the 11 digit PRN from the user.
## Theory
The prn to be entered is a 11 digit number. int is a data type whose storage is 2 bytes. Thus, int cannot store the value of the prn. Long int is a data type of 4 bytes, but this does not satisfy the length either. Either of the two above data tyypes would result in a garbage value as the output. There exists a workaround to this i.e. we can store the 11 digit prn in a data type knon as "long long int". Long long int has a memory of 8 bytes. Its format specifier is"%lld".
## Algorithm
Step 1: Start. 
Step 2: Initialize the variable prn of data type long long int. 
Step 3: Take input from user. 
Step 4: Print the enterted prn. 
Step 5: End. 
## Conclusion
This program teaches us about the need and use of long long int and its format specifier.
